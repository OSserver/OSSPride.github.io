            Benjamin Britten is one of the most popular English composers. He is seen as one of the starters of Modern
            Opera and one who relied on unconventional methods to make his operas. His most popular opera Peter Grimes
            using singular notes for the singers to sing, hitting the themes of abandonment and depression, Rape of
            Lucretia composed like a classical Greek play with a Greek style Chorus lamenting the fate of the
            characters, etc and his orchestral compositions being ones to note for the articulate nature and power they
            have with the War Requiem hitting on the horrors of war and the Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra being
            his most notable orchestrations.

            Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer
            whose music would make a lasting impression internationally. He wrote some of the most popular concert and
            theatrical music in the current classical repertoire, including the ballets Swan Lake and The Nutcracker,
            the 1812 Overture, his First Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto, the Romeo and Juliet Overture-Fantasy,
            several symphonies, and the opera Eugene Onegin.

    <h3 style="text-align: left">Peter Grimes - Benjamin Britten</h3>
    <p>
        Peter Grimes, Op. 33, is an opera by Benjamin Britten, with a libretto by Montagu Slater based on the section
        "Peter Grimes", in George Crabbe's long narrative poem The Borough. The "borough" of the opera is a fictional
        small town that bears some resemblance to Crabbe's – and later Britten's – home of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, on
        England's east coast. The work was conceived while Britten was living in the US in the early years of the Second
        World War and completed when he returned to Britain in 1943. It was first performed at Sadler's Wells in London
        on 7 June 1945, conducted by Reginald Goodall, and was a critical and popular success. It is still widely
        performed, both in Britain and internationally, and has become part of the standard repertoire. Among the tenors
        who have performed the title role in the opera house, or on record, or both are Britten's partner Peter Pears,
        who sang the part at the premiere, and Allan Clayton, Ben Heppner, Jonas Kaufmann, Philip Langridge, Stuart
        Skelton, Set Svanholm and Jon Vickers. Four Sea Interludes, consisting of purely orchestral music from the
        opera, were published separately and are frequently performed as an orchestral suite. Another interlude, a
        passacaglia, was published separately and is also often performed, either together with the Sea Interludes or by
        itself.

    <h3 style="text-align: left">Piqué Dame - Tchaikovsky</h3>
    <p>
        The Queen of Spades or Pique Dame, Op. 68, is an opera in three acts (seven scenes) by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
        to a Russian libretto by the composer's brother Modest Tchaikovsky, based on the 1834 novella of the same name
        by Alexander Pushkin, but with a dramatically altered plot. The premiere took place in 1890 at the Mariinsky
        theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
