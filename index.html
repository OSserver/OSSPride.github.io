                    were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into
                    more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and
                    pop rock. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart
                    Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The
                    latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped
                    popularise the music video format.

        This playlist consists of the choice picks of ConsoleKnight, Escudo, Jormungandr, and Mura. While not all the
        artists present in the playlist are queer, all songs are in some way or another significant to the Queer
        community.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project began as Mura's simple idea to do a Spotify playlist for Pride Month, but it quickly evolved into a
        larger project. Mostly because Escudo (totally not me writing this) is an overachieving
        nutcase. The webpage contains a link to the spotify playlist, introductory blurbs about the artists, and a
        track list with further descriptions. This little webpage was completely made by the team, and is destined to you, the community. We know
        Pride Month is special to a lot of you, so we decided to make something special. From the entire Overly
        Sarcastic Server team, happy Pride Month!

                    Diana's songwriters had noticed that her songs were popular in the gay community at the time, and so
                    the song was written as a kind of ode to that subsection of her fans. Ross has also said it holds

                    completely ambiguous whether the dream girl is something she's shooting to become, or something she
                    wants to have herself.

                    look more traditionally female. The music video depicts a CGI model of the artist, getting bent into

                    of not being able to settle down with a person he has grown up with. It was first previewed at
                    Trixie’s Ages 3 And Up show at the Laurie Beechman Theater, New York City on the 6th of November,
                    2016.

                    an interview with World of Wonder, Trixie stated that her favourite track is Seen My Man, because
                    she travels alone while on tour, and she misses seeing a familiar face every now and then.

                sports
                events in the Unites Sates and in Europe. In September 2000, it was used as the Space Shuttle wake-up
                call on day 11 of STS-106. In March 2020, the US Library of Congress added the song to its National
                Recording Registry, which preserves for posterity audio that is deemed to be of "cultural, historical or
                aesthetic significance".

                in both the US and the UK. It is an energetic, upbeat song, that to quote the artists: "draws from so

                actually about the author's own struggles with his gender identity. Will Wood identified himself as
                genderqueer, but he came to realize over time that crossdressing and wearing makeup didn't make him less
                of a man. It's about accepting the wierd parts of yourself, and being proud of who you are for what you
                are.

                Perfect". It's about the life of a teenage girl who tries to repress her feelings towards other girls.
                The song goes over how she feels attracted to her friend, but tries to hide it because "that would be
                absurd behavior for Little Miss Perfect".
